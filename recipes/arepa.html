        Arepa is a type of food made of ground maize dough stuffed with a filling, eaten in northern parts of South America 
        since pre-Columbian times, and notable primarily in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela, 
        but also present in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Panama.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; 
            gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, 
            moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; 
            pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; 
            fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
            Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
